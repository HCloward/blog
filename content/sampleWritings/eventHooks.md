title: "Event Hooks Reference"
description: "For one of my first major projects at Kong I was asked to document a feature that was part of the codebase but not yet included in the documentation, and therefore not really usable (docs are important!). The developer who wrote the feature was no longer at the company, so I had to rely on the PR he wrote and some notes he left behind. Using his notes and PR, including the schema and subschema for the different handlers, I was able to create cURL requests and generate sample responses."
