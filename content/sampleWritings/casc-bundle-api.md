title: "Metrics API reference"
description: "My first piece of API documentation. I created a template for how to organize the content based on Tom Johnson's assertion that reference documentation for API endpoints consists of 5 general sections: resource descriptions, endpoints and methods, parameters, sample requests, and sample responses. I took a document written by a developer and tested the endpoints with Postman and curl to create my sample requests. I also created a page on how to authenticate with an API token."
