title: "Multibranch Pipeline Template syntax"
description: "Document I wrote for CloudBees about how to write YAML syntax to configure Multibranch Pipelines. I was provided an automatically generated file that was in HTML and needed to be converted into Asciidoc and formatted to be easily accessible. I added a lot of links and headings to help the user navigate the structure."
