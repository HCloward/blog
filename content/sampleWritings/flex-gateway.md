title: "Getting Started with Flex Gateway"
description: "At MuleSoft, I worked with a large team of writers and was able to develop my collaboration skills. I was assigned to document a new API Gateway with another writer. There was a lot of content to cover, so while we worked together to outline what content was needed and how to organize it, we split the writing tasks between the two of us. After writing we reviewed each otherâ€™s content and approved open PRs so the content could be merged. It was nice to have a different perspective and it helped me to grow as a writer and team member."
