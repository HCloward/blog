title: "Role-based access control (RBAC) API reference"
description: "My second piece of API documentation. I created a template for how to organize the content based on Tom Johnson's assertion that reference documentation for API endpoints consists of 5 general sections: resource descriptions, endpoints and methods, parameters, sample requests, and sample responses. I took a previously published doc page and tested the endpoints with Postman and curl to create my sample requests."
