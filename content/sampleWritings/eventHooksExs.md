title: "Event Hooks Examples"
description: "As part of my first major feature documentation assignment at Kong, I was asked to document a feature that had been a part of the codebase for a while but was lacking documentation and so not used. The developer who wrote the feature was no longer at Kong, so I had to rely heavily on his notes and PR where he added the new code. Using his notes and the code in the PR, I was able to create a reference doc (also included in my sample writings) as well as several example use cases that I tested myself as I documented them."
