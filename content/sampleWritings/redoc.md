title: "Season of Docs - Redoc deployment guide"
description: "I participated in Google's Season of Docs in 2021 by contributing to Redocly's open source documentation. One of the main pieces I worked on was adding a Redoc quickstart guide. I also added some deployment guides on how to integrate Redoc with React-based projects and using the CLI to run Redoc locally."
