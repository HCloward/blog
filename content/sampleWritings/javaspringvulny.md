title: "Automate Tests with GitHub Actions Tutorial"
description: "At StackHawk, I was asked to write an end-to-end tutorial for our GitHub integration. This tutorial needed to be simple to implement, removing all barriers of entry so anyone could complete it. I created a tutorial that guides the user through the entire process and does not require any downloads or environment configurations. Afterwards, I was told to add some 'KaaKaww', applying the same voice as in other areas of the product."
