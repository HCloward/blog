title: "BOA Doc Team Process/Standards Docs Site"
description: "I created this site for my current job because my boss's boss wanted to move away from using OneDrive to host our documentation team's process and standards documents. I had never used a static site generator but wanted to learn, so I volunteered to transfer the Word documents to this Jekyll based site. I used Pandoc to transform the docx documents into markdown, then I reformatted the tables, images, and notes styles to work with the includes included with the theme. I used Tom Johnson's Jekyll documentation theme: https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll. This project is located on my work GitHub account: https://github.com/heathercloward"
