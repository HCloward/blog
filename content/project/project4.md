description: "I completed this site as a proof-of-concept for using Docusaurus for our documentation project at my position at BackOffice Associates (now Syniti). While it was fairly easy to set up and looks nice, Docusaurus did not provide for all of the functionality we required so we did not end up using it. I really enjoyed putting it together and knew enough about React to adjust the UI to fit our needs. Through this project I learned how to use GitLab's CI and wrote a script for the .gitlab-ci.yml file since GitLab did not have a sample Docusaurus project yet. Afterwards, I submitted a sample Docusaurus project for them to add to their sample projects. I also learned how to set up the search functionality through DocSearch for free."
