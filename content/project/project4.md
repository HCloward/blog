title: "Rare Purls Site"
description: "I completed this site for a friend of mine who needed her online yarn shop updated (http://www.rarepurls.net/). She had signed up for a WordPress site through GoDaddy, which I have never worked with but I was able to select a theme (https://crimson-rose.webplantmedia.com/) and adjust the layouts and CSS for what she wanted. A purl is a type of stitch in knitting."
