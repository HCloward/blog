title: "DSP (Syniti) Help"
description: "I completed this site as a proof-of-concept for using Hugo for our documentation project at my position at BackOffice Associates (now Syniti). We were looking at Hugo because of how fast it builds sites since our site had so many pages and we wanted to decrease load time. However, Hugo did not have a theme that met all of our needs, so I created my own theme using UIkit (https://getuikit.com/). The site is incomplete as I left the company before we were able to implement it, but I really enjoyed using UIkit and Hugo templating to create the site."
