title: "DSP Online Help Site"
description: "A site redesign I did for my job at BackOffice Associates (now Syniti) using MadCap Flare, CSS, HTML, and Javascript. A couple of parts I'm proud of include the arrow drop down I added next to the logo in the header, the back-to-top button that appears at the bottom right when scrolling, and the responsive design features. This project is located on my old work GitHub account: https://github.com/heathercloward"
