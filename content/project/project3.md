title: "Udacity Portfolio Site"
description: "I created this site while completing the Front End Developer Nanodegree program with Udacity (https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). I was particularly proud of completing this program because I was selected out of a large pool of applicants for the Grow with Google scholarship (https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google) which completely paid for it and it really stretched my Javascript and general web development abilities. Through the coursework I learned about progressive web apps, service workers, accessibility techniques, optimizing images, and much more. I also became more confident with the command line and using workflow tools like npm and gulp. I have only included a few of the projects from the coursework that I was most proud of and were easily uploaded to GitHub pages."
